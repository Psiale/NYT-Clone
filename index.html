                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                 equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
                    have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
                    the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
                    evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted 
                    a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
                     for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
                    uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
                    The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. 
                    Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                    like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
                    double box around it.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
                     the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
                     as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with 
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of 
                    the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric
                     of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
                      wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a 
                      trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
                      inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.


            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including 
                    Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable 
                    to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, 
                    or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and 
                    energy to science and speculation.


            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, 
                    is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
                     and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an 
                     endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
                      pasta water boiling over.

                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
                     gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                     gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, 
                     should ruffle space-time.

            <p class="main-text">
                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not 
                    part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram 
                    encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p class="main-text">
                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
                    radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 
                    380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

                    Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,

                      results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday
                       and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
