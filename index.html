            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
            and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

          </strong>

          <p class="main-text">
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
            it gets.”
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
            of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
            surface of the sun.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
            Astrophysical Journal.

          The Theory of Inflation
        </strong>
        <div class="caption-text scenes_left_align">
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

              <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position
              in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about
              92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
              look, the universe has an even temperature.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-2 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have
              traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the
              other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of
              hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
            </p>
          </li>

            <div class="scene-3 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to
              look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the
              amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it
              has cooled.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-4 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE </strong>Now turn around and look a mile in the other
              direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
              temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
              every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-5 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry
              coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all
              the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all
              at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-6 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
               trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster 
               than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy 
               field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-7 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations 
              in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left 
              over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="scene-8 scene_all"></div>
            <p>
              <strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than
               light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. 
               That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and 
               foam of the original pot.

                  By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen 
                  and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

                  Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true,
                   it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”

                  John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                   project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
                    “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                  Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash
                   of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result
                    would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.

                <p class="main-text">
                  Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                   noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the 
                   cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions 
                   about the universe.

                  Corroboration might not be long in coming. 
                  The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other
                   teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

                <p class="main-text">
                  Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, 
                  which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years
                   ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                  Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
                   He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly 
                   sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal 
                   observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, 
                   Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                <p class="main-text">
                  “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” 
                  Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. 
                  “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                    In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave 
                    radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one 
                    direction rather than another.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves 
                    from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it
                     in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                      theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little
                       arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in 
                    the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a 
                    giant superconducting thermometer.

                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
                     Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
                     beat them to the breakthrough.

                    A Special Time
                </strong>
                <p class="main-text">
                    The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, 
                    staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break 
                    point in the evolution of the universe.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    As the universe cooled, according to this theory,
                    there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers
                     falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after 
                     another splitting away.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    That was where Dr. Guth came in.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the 
                    temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point 
                    it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long.
                     In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of 
                    antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself 
                    supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
                     trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a 
                     grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and 
                    radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s 
                    observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. 
                    “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes 
                    to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. 
                    Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. 
                    Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the 
                    rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, 
                    a concept known as the multiverse.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about 
                    going any deeper into the past.
                </p>
                <p class="main-text">
                    We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                     everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
                      away, forever out of our view.

                <p class="main-text">
                    “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of
                     the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
